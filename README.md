# 📊 Expense Tracker – Simple CLI-Based Budget Manager

A simple command-line **Expense Tracker** built with Python. This tool helps you manage your personal spending by allowing you to **add**, **view**, and **calculate** expenses, all stored in a local text file (`expenses.txt`). The program uses **file handling** for data storage and **exception handling** to ensure smooth execution.
